Set Up Your Project
-------------------

Create the Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a new directory and initialize your project with ``dotnet new``.

.. code-block:: shell

   mkdir csharp-quickstart
   cd csharp-quickstart
   dotnet new console --framework net6.0

Add MongoDB as a Dependency
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use ``dotnet add`` to add the C#/.NET driver to your project as a dependency.

.. code-block:: shell

   dotnet add package MongoDB.Driver

Create a MongoDB Cluster
------------------------

.. include:: /includes/quick-start/atlas-setup.rst

Query Your MongoDB Cluster from Your Application
------------------------------------------------

First, save your Atlas connection string to an environment variable named ``MONGODB_URI``. This way, you don't need to include your credentials in the source code.

.. code-block:: bash

   export MONGODB_URI='<your atlas connection string>'

.. note::

   Make sure to replace the "<username>" and "<password>" sections of the connection string with the username and password you created for your user with **atlasAdmin** permissions.

Next, open the file named ``Program.cs`` in the base directory of your project. 
Use the following sample code to run a query against your sample dataset in MongoDB Atlas.

.. literalinclude:: /includes/quick-start/Program.cs
   :language: csharp
   :dedent:

Run the sample code with the following command from your command line:

.. code-block:: bash

   dotnet run csharp-quickstart.csproj

.. include:: /includes/quick-start/query-output.rst

.. tip::

   If your output is empty, ensure you have loaded the
   :atlas:`sample datasets </sample-data/>` into your cluster.

After completing this step, you should have a working application that uses
the {+driver-short+} to connect to your MongoDB cluster, run a query on the
sample data, and print out the result.
