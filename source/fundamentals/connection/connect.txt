This guide shows you how to connect to a MongoDB instance or replica set
deployment using the {+driver-short+}.

Connection URI
--------------

A **connection URI**, also known as a *connection string*, tells the driver how to connect to a MongoDB deployment and how to behave while connected. A standard connection string includes the connection protocol, hostname of the server, and port where MongoDB is listening for connections. It may also include user credentials and other connection options.

The following code uses a sample connection URI to connect to a MongoDB instance on port ``27017`` of ``sample.host``:
